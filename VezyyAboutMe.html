                <h3>Hi, I'm Sebastian | Vezyy</h3>
                <p>VPanda is the logo I use for my Virtual Panda projects.</p>
                <p>I drink large amounts of coffee and love playing various games. Virtual worlds provide an escape where one can do things not possible in real life. Programming in Python and C++, using Unreal Engine 5, creating projects with Blueprints, and designing 3D models in Blender are some of my interests. I also enjoy video editing and have a passion for pandas.</p>
                <p>I'm from Gda≈Ñsk, Pomorskie. I despise laziness, people who harm others, and social pathologies. I'm generally calm, but push the right buttons and I can get annoyed. If I know something and see it, I'm always up for a chat or to help out in virtual world-related matters. I'm open to collaborating on projects or assisting with them. I have an interest in space missions beyond our globe, military technology, and IT. I'm also a bit of a sports enthusiast, particularly football.</p>
                <p>I love watching movies, especially in cinemas, as it provides a different experience than just staring at a computer screen, where I spend a lot of time pursuing my passion.</p>
